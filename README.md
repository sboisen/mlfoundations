# Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains supplemental materials for 
[Machine Learning Foundations](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations/home/welcome)
from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). 

The course is organized to use
the [GraphLab](https://turi.com/learn/coursera/) library. The instructors
advocate this for ease of installation and scalability. 

> GraphLab Create is a highly scalable machine learning library for
> Python, which also includes the SFrame, a highly-scalable library
> for data manipulation. A huge advantage of SFrame over Pandas is
> that with SFrame, you are not limited to datasets that fit in
> memory, which allows you to deal with large datasets, even on a
> laptop.

However, after installing GraphLab per their instructions (using
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/)), i couldn't get their
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook to run. So i started
translating their notebooks that use SFrames into others using
[Python Data Analysis Library â€” pandas: Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
just so i could complete the assignment. These notebooks should
operate correctly using Anaconda 4.3 as the backend.
